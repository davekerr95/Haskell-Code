#Haskell Code

Book: Learn you a Haskell for great good!

###Introduction
As part of my studies during the Summer to improve myself I decided to give functional programming a try and to learn Haskell, I started by reading and teaching myself from the book listed above.

All of the code in this repository is either from exercises in the book or work I have done in my spare time.
